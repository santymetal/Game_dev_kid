Based on their idea, create a simple, fun game concept that a 5-year-old can understand and enjoy. The game should be:
- Very simple with basic mechanics
- Colorful and engaging
- Easy to control (arrow keys, mouse clicks, or space bar)
- Encouraging and positive
- Safe and appropriate for children

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "gameType": "jumping|puzzle|racing|creative|adventure|collection",
  "title": "Short, fun game title",
  "description": "Simple description a 5-year-old would understand",
  "character": "Main character (animal, person, etc.)",

    "secondary": "#hexcolor", 
    "background": "#hexcolor"
  },
  "elements": ["list", "of", "game", "elements"],
  "encouragement": "Positive message for the child"
}

Make sure the game is inspired by their idea but simplified for their age. Use bright, cheerful colors and include elements they mentioned.`;
